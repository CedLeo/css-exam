### Evaluation

 - Theme and Consistency
   - The website adheres the given Figma design, and is consistent in its use of fonts, colors, spacing, and other design elements
 - Code Structure
   - The code is easy to read and understand. It is maintainable and follows clean code principles of DRY (with the use of components).
 - Functionality
   - The navigation and subject section buttons are wired and perform their associated actions properly when clicked. The latest post carousel functions correctly and changes the data presented in the correct interval or when interacted with.
 - Animation
   - The website uses animations appropriately, providing interactive feedback to the user whenever actions are performed such as hovering over elements, clicking buttons, or navigating.
 - Layout
   - The website is responsive. Elements collapse into smaller variants at proper intervals and the website has no overflow under constrained screen sizes.
